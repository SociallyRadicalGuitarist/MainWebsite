                Christian Shingiro is a musician from the KW region that was born in Rwanda and has been active in radical politics for five years. 
                He was raised as a musician and taught classically by his father, Ignace Ryangoma, a Berklee College of Music alumni. 
                When he was ready to play live performances, he joined the family project known as The Magical Bunch, which was active from when he was 12 up until he was 17.
                He has an appreciation for the versatility and beauty of the guitar, and is aware of the role that the guitar has played in social movements around the world.
                The major political events of the 2008 financial crash, the wars in Libya and Syria, and the encounter of alternative media have awoken him to a political epiphany that will never go to rest!  
                He is out to show the world, in quoting Communist Party of Kenya's political candidate, that it's time to "think outside of the box" when it comes to politics, and that politics and guitar do indeed mix!
